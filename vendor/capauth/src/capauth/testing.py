"""TEST SEAM: stands in for the gpg subprocess so tests can sign without a key.

    THIS IS NOT A PRODUCTION BYPASS.

If you have found this module in a repo's import list and are wondering whether
someone has switched off CapAuth's authorization checks, the answer is no, and
here is the short version before the detail.

**What it stubs:** the gpg *subprocess* boundary, and nothing else. Three
attributes of :mod:`capauth.tokens` are replaced with in-process stand-ins:
``_get_issuer_fingerprint``, ``_pgp_sign_payload``, and the ``verify_manifest``
that module imported. That is the whole surface. It exists because a CI runner
has no secret key and no unlocked agent, so without it every token mint raises
and every gated route 403s.

**What it does NOT weaken, at all, while active:**

* :func:`capauth.authz.decide`'s signature gate. An unsigned token is still
  denied, including for RCE-tier capabilities like ``skcode.dispatch``. A token
  whose payload was tampered with after signing is still denied. A token
  declaring one issuer while signed by another is still denied. The stand-in
  signature is a digest of the exact payload bytes, checked against the exact
  declared issuer, so all three of those keep failing exactly as they do
  against real gpg.
* The verified-tier enrollment floor. Enrollment mode, its proof requirement
  (:func:`capauth.pairing.enroll_device` validating ``proof`` / ``attestation``
  against real signatures), and the minimum-mode requirement each capability
  rule declares are untouched. The stub replaces no part of
  :mod:`capauth.pairing`.
* The raise-on-signing-failure behaviour of :func:`capauth.tokens.issue_token`
  and :func:`capauth.tokens.mint_audience_token`. With the stub inactive,
  signing failure still raises :class:`capauth.tokens.TokenSigningError` and
  still writes nothing to the token store. The stub does not soften that path;
  it simply makes signing succeed, so the path is not reached.
* The server-derived-subject property. The stub never touches how a PEP derives
  the subject it passes to ``decide``; a caller still cannot assert its own
  identity through it.
* :func:`capauth.tokens.signature_verifies` itself, which runs unmodified:
  empty-signature check, unattributable-issuer check, canonical payload bytes,
  issuer pinning.

In short, it removes gpg as a dependency of a test, not a check from the PDP.
The negative controls in ``tests/test_testing_helper.py`` pin every claim in the
list above, and one of them runs in a fresh subprocess specifically so it cannot
be fooled by this module having been imported.

**Where it cannot reach:** a deployed process, structurally. See "Why this
cannot be switched on by accident in a deployed process" at the end of this
docstring.

Why this module is shipped rather than kept in ``tests/conftest.py``
--------------------------------------------------------------------
:func:`capauth.authz.decide` requires the granting token to carry a signature
that verifies over its exact payload bytes, made by the key the payload names as
issuer, and :func:`capauth.tokens.issue_token` now RAISES rather than storing an
unsigned token when signing fails. Both are correct: an unsigned token used to
be issued anyway and used to grant RCE capabilities.

The consequence is that real gpg (a secret key present, an agent unlocked)
became a hard dependency of any suite that expects an ALLOW. A GitHub Actions
runner has neither, so every downstream repo that mints a capability token in
its tests started failing at the mint, or 403ing at the gate. CapAuth's own
suite never had that problem because it carried this stub privately in
``tests/conftest.py``, where no downstream repo could reach it. This module is
that same stub, promoted into importable, shipped code.

What the stub fakes, and what it deliberately does not
------------------------------------------------------
It fakes ONLY the gpg subprocess, at exactly three seams in
:mod:`capauth.tokens`:

* ``_get_issuer_fingerprint`` so issued tokens name a plausible issuer instead
  of the ``"unknown"`` placeholder (which ``signature_verifies`` correctly
  refuses as unattributable);
* ``_pgp_sign_payload`` so ``sign=True`` yields a stand-in signature over the
  payload's canonical bytes;
* ``verify_manifest`` so verification accepts exactly that stand-in, for exactly
  those bytes, from exactly that issuer.

Everything else runs unmodified, including the whole of
:func:`capauth.tokens.signature_verifies` (empty-signature check,
unattributable-issuer check, canonical payload bytes, issuer pinning) and the
whole PDP. The stand-in "signature" is a digest of the exact bytes signed, so
with the stub active:

* an UNSIGNED token is still denied;
* a token whose payload was tampered with after signing is still denied;
* a signature lifted from another token is still denied;
* a token declaring a different issuer than the one that signed is still denied.

A stub that just returned ``True`` would restore the very defect the signature
gate closes (SEC-CRIT ``bc56b98b``: an unsigned token granting
``skcode.dispatch``) while turning every downstream suite green, which is
strictly worse than a red suite. Those properties are pinned by
``tests/test_testing_helper.py``.

This is a substitute for gpg in a hermetic test, NOT a substitute for OpenPGP.
Real end-to-end signing and verification against a real generated key is covered
separately in ``tests/test_authz_signature_gate.py``, which must keep running
WITHOUT this stub.

Adopting it downstream
----------------------
One line in the consuming repo's ``tests/conftest.py`` turns it on for every
test under that directory::

    from capauth.testing import capauth_signing_stub  # noqa: F401

Or, to opt in per test / per module instead of directory-wide, request the
non-autouse fixture::

    from capauth.testing import stub_token_signing  # noqa: F401

    pytestmark = pytest.mark.usefixtures("stub_token_signing")

Outside pytest entirely, :func:`signing_stub` is a plain context manager.

Why this cannot be switched on by accident in a deployed process
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Nothing in CapAuth's runtime imports it. ``import capauth`` does not pull it
   in, and no module under ``capauth/`` references it. A test asserts that.
2. Importing it requires ``pytest``, which is a dev-extra only, absent from
   ``capauth``'s runtime dependencies and from the ``service`` extra. In a
   deployed process ``import capauth.testing`` raises ``ModuleNotFoundError``
   before any seam could be touched.
3. It registers no ``pytest11`` entry point, so pytest never auto-loads it. A
   consuming repo has to name it in its own test code.
4. Importing it patches nothing. Every activation path is an explicit call whose
   effect is lexically scoped and reverted on exit (``monkeypatch`` teardown, or
   the context manager's ``__exit__``).
5. There is no env var, config key, or global flag that enables it. There is
   deliberately no ``CAPAUTH_ALLOW_UNSIGNED``-style switch anywhere: a flag
   production config could set is exactly how a test helper ends up live.
