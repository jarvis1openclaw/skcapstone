"""Identity classes: a structural ceiling on what a KIND of identity may ever do.

Card fc6500cb (SKWorld node-roles epic). This module answers a question the
capability-token model deliberately does not: not "does this subject hold the
grant today?" but "is this subject the KIND of thing that may hold it at all?".

Why a class layer exists at all
-------------------------------
:func:`capauth.authz.decide` is a grant checker. A node that simply has no
``token:issue`` grant is safe only for as long as nobody issues it one. The
moment an operator fat-fingers a mint, or a wildcard (``Capability.ALL``) token
lands in the Syncthing-replicated store under a node's subject, that node can
mint tokens for the whole fleet. "Not granted today" is a state; "may never be
granted" is a property. This module supplies the property.

An :class:`IdentityClass` is therefore a CEILING, not a grant:

* ``forbidden_capabilities`` can never be exercised by a subject of this class,
  no matter what token the subject holds. The ``node`` class forbids
  :attr:`~capauth.tokens.Capability.ALL` (the ``"*"`` grant),
  :attr:`~capauth.tokens.Capability.TOKEN_ISSUE` and
  :attr:`~capauth.tokens.Capability.IDENTITY_SIGN`: no operator secrets, no
  agent signing, no minting.
* ``allowed_capabilities`` is the positive half of the ceiling. When it does not
  carry the ``"*"`` wildcard it is an ALLOWLIST: a capability that is not listed
  is denied even though nothing explicitly forbids it. A node holds inference
  and read scopes only, so anything new that appears in the rule table is denied
  for nodes by default instead of silently becoming reachable.
* ``minimum_mode`` is an enrollment floor the class imposes on top of whatever
  floor the requested capability's own rule carries. A class may raise that
  floor, never lower it (the PDP evaluates both, and both must be satisfied).

Where the ceiling is enforced
-----------------------------
:func:`capauth.authz.decide` evaluates the class BEFORE it reads any token. That
ordering is the whole point: a token cannot raise a ceiling that was already
applied to the request. A node-class subject holding a valid, signed
``Capability.ALL`` token is still denied ``token:issue``, because the request was
refused before the store was ever consulted.

Because the ceiling is checked against the REQUESTED capability rather than
against the tokens found, a wildcard token buys a classed subject nothing beyond
its class: every capability the class forbids (or does not allow) is denied on
the way in, wildcard or not.

Assignment is stored, not asserted
----------------------------------
A subject's class lives in a small JSON file under the same injectable storage
root the pairing devices and capability tokens use
(``<base_dir>/identity/classes.json``, a flat ``{subject: class name}`` map). It
is deliberately NOT taken from request context: a class the caller can assert is
a class an attacker can assert, and the ceiling would then be theirs to raise.

Unclassified subjects are the default
-------------------------------------
:func:`resolve_identity_class` returns ``None`` for any subject with no
assignment, and the PDP then behaves EXACTLY as it did before this module
existed. This layer is opt-in per subject: the fleet's existing identities keep
their current outcomes until an operator classifies them.

Fail closed on a broken assignment
----------------------------------
An assignments file that cannot be read or parsed, or one naming a class that
does not exist, raises :class:`IdentityClassError`. The PDP turns that into a
deny. A store we cannot read is an uncertainty like any other in the authz
kernel, and the alternative (treating an unreadable file as "no assignments")
would let deleting or corrupting one file remove every ceiling at once.
